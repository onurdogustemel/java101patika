# Insertion sort of the array [22,27,16,2,18,6]

## 1) Sorting steps
- [22,27,16,2,18,6] (n)
- [16,22,27,2,18,6] (n-1)
- [2,16,22,27,18,6] (n-2)
- [2,16,18,22,27,6] (n-3)
- [2,6,16,18,22,27] (n-4)

## 2) Big-O Notation

Big-O Notation is O(n^2).

## 3) Time Complexity, Average case, Worst case, Best case

- Average case: O(n^2)
- Worst case: O(n^2)
- Best case: O(n)

## 4) In which case does the value 18 take place after the array is sorted?

Average case
